ClearMap is a toolbox for the analysis and registration of volumetric data
from cleared tissues.

ClearMap is targeted towards large lightsheet volumetric imaging data
of iDISCO+ cleared mouse brains samples, their registration to the Allen brain atlas,
volumetric image processing and statistical analysis.
